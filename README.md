# 3factor

Today, it is possible to build backends for apps that allow for fast iteration, while being resilient and highly scalable from the get go. 

The backend architecture for such apps can use the best of the ecosystem today to achieve this. Specifically, the following **3 factors**<sup>*</sup>:

1. Realtime GraphQL
2. Event-driven
3. Async serverless

<sup>*</sup> *Inspired of course, by the [12factors](https://12factor.net) that the Heroku folks put together 7 years ago.*

Here's a comparison of a food-delivery application's traditional architecture with a 3factor one:

## Realtime GraphQL: Iterate faster on your frontend

GraphQL APIs result in a much faster front-end developer workflow. In addition to speaking GraphQL, your API should also support the following 2 properties:

- **Low-latency**: An end-user should see [instant
  feedback](https://stackoverflow.com/a/164290/3364697) of an action and not
  have to wait on an API (<100ms ideal, upto 1 second at worst).
- **Support GraphQL subscriptions**: Consuming information
  asynchronously from the backend i.e a “realtime” GraphQL API. 
  
Refactor high-latency synchronous API responses to be reactive instead.

##### Example: 
Instead of REST APIs, use GraphQL as much as possible to improve frontend app
development. Further, consider a naive GraphQL mutation to place an order
that would have executed a workflow or orchestrated microservices and hence
taken a longer time to respond. Refactor this to an “atomic” GraphQL mutation
that “places” an order and responds with an “order-id”. Update UI based on
realtime workflow updates to the order-id, that the end-user can consume,
confident that the order is placed and does not need their attention.

## Event-driven: Make your backend resilient

Remove workflow and orchestration state from your backend APIs and persist them
into events. Your event system should have 2 properties:

- Atomic: Changes to the backend datastore, via GraphQL mutations or otherwise should
atomically emit events so that there is a guarantee that events are always created.
- Reliable: Events once emitted should be delivered atleast once 

##### Example: 
Instead of writing an “place order” API endpoint that orchestrates
upstream microservices by making API calls to them in a workflow, emit events
that capture the state machine. Your event system should deliver the events
reliably to other microservices. This makes your application resilient to
transient failures because the retry/failure logic is captured in the event
system. It makes your application resilient to larger scale failures because the
event-system and your data store can easily be replicated across availability
zones making application recovery straightforward.

## Async serverless: Scale your backend infinitely

Write business logic with serverless compute that is asynchronously triggered. 
This also mitigates the cold-start issue from causing slower perceived latency.

- Prepare for atleast-once: Your serverless business logic that is triggered by events
  might get triggered more than once. Try to write your code in a way where it doesn't 
  matter if it is triggered multiple times (idempotent) or add relevant checks.
- Modify state & trigger events: Your logic might cause a change in application state 
  and trigger more events
- Communicate asynchronously to the end-user app via changes in application state that
  clients can consume via GraphQL subscriptions

This also allows for rapid iteration in the business logic without impacting the
GraphQL contract.

##### Example: 
In your food ordering workflow, instead of writing a payment processing
microservice that captures different failure modes, write a payment processing
function that processes a payment or fails. The event system should capture the
retry or failure handling logic so that your business logic is simple and easy
to scale.

---------------------------------------------------------

A 3factor app requires you to remove state from your code and put it in your
datastore and in your event queues. Cloud vendors make it easy to scale and replicate
your datastore and event-queues. Making your business logic asynchronous requires a proportional 
investment in your realtime GraphQL API to allow the end-user app to consume asynchronous information easily. 

An interesting sidenote: A 3factor app is analogous to the [redux](https://redux.js.org/) dataflow
model on a react app, but applied to the fullstack.
